Calculations of impurity charge susceptibility
RZ, 2021

small cluster, 2 bath sites, U=10, eps=-5, Gamma=1

n_el=3 sector:
E_gs = -2.51293
n_imp = 0.997624
g_01 = -0.00381294 (sign is arbitrary)
2 * sum |g_{0i}|^2/(E_i-E_0) = 0.00486367
Results from small_cluster/ed.nb

dir small_clusters: results.dat from DMRG are OK!

Results for chi from tau integration: 
Re[A1+A2] = 0.004870128 for wr=0.25, eta=0.1
Re[A1+A2] = 0.0048637   for wr=0, eta=0 ; results from tau-wr=0/ed-tau.nb

perfect agreement!
